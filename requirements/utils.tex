Different pieces of code, not specifically attributed to any other package,
but useful for more than one other package.


\subsection{Pretty-Printer}
\label{sec:prettyprinter}

A simple \emph{pretty-printer} with tabulated ascii-output, primarily intended
for diagnosis. It should be used for testing and debugging the other parts
already during development.


\subsubsection*{Interface}

The pretty-printer can used (and is supposed to be used) by everyone for
debugging. The only interface that counts is the abstract syntax, which
must be printable. The interface is partially implemented, for the usage,
see \texttt{utils.PpExample}. Besides the \texttt{print}-for whole
programs, the same methods is provided publicly also for other syntactic
constructs to make them printable for diagnosis.
