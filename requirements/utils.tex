Different pieces of code, not specifically attributed to any other package,
but useful for more than one other package.


\subsection{Pretty-Printer}
\label{sec:prettyprinter}

\team{Karsten Stahl, Martin Steffen}

A simple \emph{pretty-printer} with tabulated ascii-output, primarily intended
for diagnosis. It should be used for testing and debugging the other parts
already during development.


\subsubsection*{Interface}

The pretty-printer can used (and is supposed to be used) by everyone for
debugging. The only interfac that counts is the abstract syntax, which must be
printable. The interface is partially implemented, for the usage, see
\texttt{utils.PpExample}. Besides the \texttt{print}-for whole programs, the
same methods is provided publicly also for other syntactic constructs to make
them printable for diagnosis.
