 snapshot1:  12.6.2002
	     After the restructuring, adding the slime prefix.
	     Intended date for integration, but not all have delivered code yet.
	     

 snapshot2:  3.7.2002
	     After CLASSPATH/Lex/Cup discussion. The old
	     Status is restored: compilabilite (make clean; make)	
	     with the new classpath.
	
	     sfcparser is not yet compilable (but was not before, as well)
