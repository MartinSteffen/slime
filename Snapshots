This file contains, for quick reference, a list of the major development
steps, called snapshots or baselines, as kept in cvs's symbolic tags.

If any of the developers snapshots his part, he should _not_ use tags of
the form snapshot<nr> as those are reserved for the global snapshots.

----------------------------------------





 secondcompilation-sep: 9.07.2002
	    everything compiles (the check's is commented out from the makefile, though)
	    This baseline does not correspond to any actual state in space-time,
	    I went back in time for a few classes to make it fit together.
	    The classes are:

	      absynt/    everything that has to do with the extended visitor
	      sfcparser/ the line that required the sfcparser/PrettyPrint.java
	
	   Besides that it compiles now, the type-checker does not semantically
	   work now, since by going back in time in absynt, the equals-methods
	   are gone, as well.


	    


 firstcompilaton-sep:   3.7.2002
             Now, everything compiles, including parser.
	     But the compilation is still separate one by one per
	     subdirectory.
	  
	





 snapshot2:  3.7.2002
	     After CLASSPATH/Lex/Cup discussion. The old
	     Status is restored: compilabilite (make clean; make)	
	     with the new classpath.
	
	     sfcparser is not yet compilable (but was not before, as well)



 snapshot1:  12.6.2002
	     After the restructuring, adding the slime prefix.
	     Intended date for integration, but not
             all have delivered code yet.
