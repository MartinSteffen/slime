\section*{Snapshots}
\label{sec:snapshots}


The \emph{baselines} or \emph{snapshots} are archived here for quick
reference as \texttt{slime\_v[x].jar}, where \texttt{[x]} is the number or
the tag of the snapshot. Developers with access to the source repository
can retrieve those snapshots of course with cvs.\footnote{The command is
  \texttt{cvs update -r [tag]}. Be careful with this command, don't
  generate development branches without knowing.}


To \emph{execute} one of the archived snapshots, save it at some convenient
place, set the \texttt{CLASSPATH} (or use the \texttt{-classpath} option)
of \texttt{java}) to include the saved jar-file + the required versions of
\texttt{JLex} and \texttt{java\_cup}, and do\footnote{Since the archive is
  not stand-alone in that it requires additionally at run-time the lexer
  and the parser generator, the archive is not executable with the
  \texttt{-jar} option.}

\begin{center}
  \texttt{java <slimeversion>.jar slime.Main}
\end{center}


The \emph{required} version is \texttt{jdk1.4,} earlier version may cause
trouble, later ones are not tested.
