\section*{Snapshots}
\label{sec:snapshots}


The \emph{baselines} or \emph{snapshots} are archived here for quick
reference as \texttt{slime\_v[x].jar}, where \texttt{[x]} is the number or
the tag of the snapshot. Developers with access to the source repository
can retrieve those snapshots of course with cvs.\footnote{The command is
  \texttt{cvs update -r [tag]}. Be careful with this command, don't
  generate development branches without knowing.}


To \emph{execute} one of the archived snapshots, save it at some convenient
place, and do (from version 3 on)

\begin{center}
  \texttt{java -jar slime\_v[x].jar}
\end{center}


In the versions befor, set the the classpath to point to the jar-archve,
and invoke the interpreter, i.e., Java's virtual machine as indicated in
the table below. For instance, after downloading, you can do

\begin{verbatim}
  java -classpath ./slime_v[x].jar <command>
\end{verbatim}
to start the tool. Alternatively, you can set the
\texttt{CLASSPATH}-variable appropriatly, in which case the
\texttt{-classpath}-option is not needed.


In any case, the \emph{required} version is \texttt{jdk1.4,} earlier
version may cause trouble, later ones are not tested.
