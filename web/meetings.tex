Organisatorial/procedural things discussed during the meeting at 3.7.02
included arguments mentioned \url{slides/meeting030702.ps}{here.}


\iffalse
Here the \important{official decision} concerning the \texttt{CLASSPATH}
etc. (same is in \texttt{Readme.devel}).

\begin{itemize}
\item the \importantxx{checked-in} versions of cup and lex are
  obligatory\footnote{They replace the ones previously used under
    \texttt{/home/java}, which had been the official ones so far. In
    effect, they are the same, and just checked in.}
\item the following \importantxx{classpath} is obligatory:
  \texttt{CLASSPATH=<WORKDIR>/Slime/src:<WORKDIR>/Slime/lib/JLex.jar:<WORKDIR>/Slime/lib/java_cup.jar:}
  where of course the \texttt{<WORKDIR>} is a placeholder and it has to be
  adapted by the individual user to his work directory.
\item no \importantxx{generated} files nor \importantxx{class} files will be
  checked in (unless technical reasons call for it, in which case we will
  discuss this in the light of the new arguments again)
\item no \importantxx{non-slime} code or data will be checked in under
  \texttt{CLASSPATH=<WORKDIR>/Slime/src}
\item revisions \emph{log}s are useful and worth reading, but it's not
  mandatory to read each other's logs.
\end{itemize}
