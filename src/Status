	parser:    compilable, serious lackings (see error file)
	editor:    functional
	gui:       no code.
	utils:     complable and used
	
overall:           no integration









For the meeting at 8.5.02: Presentation of the groups 

   
    o general questions/problems:

	- everyone content with the semantics?
	- what to do with missing check-group?
	- presentation of the workgroups?
	- How did everyone used the additional time?
	- when should we start integration?


     o specific questions:

	- what about the conventions proposed by Marco Wendel (and
	  discussed on the mailing list?
  
              package-namen, bzw. restruckturierung des Verzeichnisses.

          > till when should it be done (if at all)?	
	  > Gui should make the Manifest + jarrable package

     o single groups:

        - requirements: fomal semantics provided, no comments 
	     from the groups yet.

	- Gui: 

	     > ssh/cvs access works now?

	     > how to store programs?

	     > conventions for storing?
	           conflicts with parser?

	     > Interface with editor?

	- layout: 
	     > stand-alone compilable!
	     > fast progress claimed

	- absynt: nothing new, if the checks are gone + if we
	          are supposed to do something there, we propose
	          to cancel the iterator stuff.
              > compiles standalone

	    proposed: 
	        > ``input x'': not done
   	        >  privat field + accessors: not done
	        >  iterators: not done, proposal to cancel this

            postponed (last time): 
	        > cloneable/singleton?

	- editor: 
	      > everything's clear? we got no feedback as yet!
	      > discuss with the gui, how gui invokes editor etc.
	         and also with the other groups

	- parser:
	     > feedback: ok
	     > promised: syntax proposal/example-program
	 
        - simulator:
	     > feedback: ?
	     > is the semantics clear?
