This file contains errors, bugs, features etc encountered in the
development process. The format of an error report should roughly adheres
to the following format:


  --------------------------------------------------------
  Error <nr>:    <short description>
    package:     <in which package/class does it occur
    status:      reported|confirmed|non-confirmed|repaired
	         repaired-confirmed

	       + <date> + <author>
   
    class:       fatal|non-fatal|
                 feature-request|coding convention violation ....

    description: <longer description, hints for repair>
   -----------------------------------------------------




Rules of the game:

	- In general, if someone reports an error in another package,
          the author should at least confirm the error.
  
        - If the error has been removed or otherwise been dealt
	  with, it should be copied to the bottom of the file
	  to the repaired errors section
