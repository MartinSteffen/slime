This file contains errors, bugs, features etc encountered in the
development process. The format of an error report should roughly adheres
to the following format:


  --------------------------------------------------------
  Error <nr>:    <short description>
    package:     <in which package/class does it occur
    status:      reported|confirmed|non-confirmed|repaired
	         repaired-confirmed

	       + <date> + <author>
   
    class:       fatal|non-fatal|
                 feature-request|coding convention violation ....

    description: <longer description, hints for repair>
   -----------------------------------------------------




Rules of the game:

	- In general, if someone reports an error in another package,
          the author should at least confirm the error.
  
        - If the error has been removed or otherwise been dealt
	  with, the reporter should be informed explicitely, who can
	  check whether he think's it's indeed repaired, and the 
	  entry should be copied to the bottom of the file
	  to the repaired errors section

  status:     reported, 26.6.02, Boeck/Steffen
  description: probably confusion with the new stuff added by 
               sfc parser. (Well, not clear) Breaks everything!!! Probably name confusion
	       with the sfcparser-Parser with the utils-Parser.

	        The error in more than one sub-directory is a cup-error:

                java java_cup.Main -symbols sym -parser Parser -nonterms -package utils SAP.cup  
               Unrecognized option "SAP.cup"

 package:      all
 status:       reported, 26.6.02
 class:        potentially fatal, cause of confusion
 description:  new subdir's added, but not announced, nor
               added to the readme, nor added to the Makefile

Error 16:      LEX/YACC
 package:      (sfcpasrser)
 status:       reported, 26.6.02
 class:        question, potetntial cause of trouble
 description:  is it necessary, to check in the in
               LEX/YACC, especially only in class files,
	       (and no MAKEFILE!) to rebuild it???????
               What influence does it have to the
	       global structure?


 
Error 15:      typed variables?
 package:      sfcparser

 status:       reported/posed/fatal, 26.6.02, Steffen
 description:  need the variable a type-field? 
               Perhaps one could remove it, would be cleaner for
	       the Hashtable implementation of the type
	       checker. Or even better overwrite equals, because
	       there are also the pos-field.
	       Without any change, the Hashtable implementation
	       will not work.
	       

Error 14:      checked in class files
 package:      sfcparser
 status:       non-fatal (but potential source of curious errors

Error 13:      package structure 
 package:      sfcparser
 status:       fatal (in the end)
 reported:     25.6.02, Steffen
 description:  there's no package declaration in the javafiles.
               perhaps this also leads to the non-generation of doc-documents.
	       Why is the an import io.* needed? 
	       What is the use of packacke io anyway? If not needed, we 
	       should remove it.
