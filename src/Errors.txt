This file contains errors, bugs, features etc encountered in the
development process. The format of an error report should roughly adheres
to the following format:


  --------------------------------------------------------
  Error <nr>:    <short description>
    package:     <in which package/class does it occur
    status:      reported|confirmed|non-confirmed|repaired
	         repaired-confirmed

	       + <date> + <author>
   
    class:       fatal|non-fatal|
                 feature-request|coding convention violation ....

    description: <longer description, hints for repair>
   -----------------------------------------------------




Rules of the game:

	- In general, if someone reports an error in another package,
          the author should at least confirm the error.
  
        - If the error has been removed or otherwise been dealt
	  with, the reporter should be informed explicitely, who can
	  check whether he think's it's indeed repaired, and the 
	  entry should be copied to the bottom of the file
	  to the repaired errors section
