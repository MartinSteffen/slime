SFCParser v1.0 - part of the Slime Project
[Programming-in-the-many: Java SS2002 CAU Kiel]

The SFCParser should be capable to read an ASCII-file

URLS.html:	Short list of JLex and CUP related URLs.

Makefile:	Makefile for gnumake. Run "make all" to create the

SFC.lex:	JLex specification needed for the generation of

		reside in the JavaClassPath.

SFCLex.java:    JLex Scanner Code generated from SFC.lex

SFCParser.java: CUP Parser Code generated from SFC.cup

Absfc2SFCConverter.java:
		Object is should be capable to convert a
		slime.absynt.absfc.SFCabtree into a wanted/
		required slime.absynt.SFC.

PrettyPrint4Absfc.java:
		You may normally not need it, it is just useful
		for developers working on Absfc2SFCConverter.
		It is a modified version of src/slime/utils/PrettyPrint.java

SFC.cup:	CUP specification needed for the generation of
		SFCParser.java and SFCSymbols.java. 

SFCParseException.java:
		ExceptionClass for passing internal

examples.?.sfc:	Some examples for the SFC language parsable by SFCParser.
		Some examples do still not function.		

out.?.txt:      Outputs generated by one of the scripts 
		testsfc.bat or testsfc.sh.

testsfc.bat:	DOS-BATCH-script for running the ParserTest
		on multiple examples (normally example.0.sfc to example.9.sfc).
		
testsfc.sh:	bash-script for running the ParserTest
		on multiple examples (normally example.0.sfc to example.9.sfc).
