       - use inner classes perhaps for better grouping.
         for instance collect the types together etc.

       - LinkedList are too ``generic'', too much casting,
         too little type information. It is perhaps also 
	 not nice that for the linked lists we don't have 
	 the acceptor/visitor convention.

       - types: the equality check as overriding method equal
         is a bit of a hack

       - the exception structure is not nice, it would
         be better to have an abstract superclass 
	 that requires message and explanation,
	 or an interface. Also it would be better 
	 to _enforce_ that exceptions can only
	 be thrown with an argument.
