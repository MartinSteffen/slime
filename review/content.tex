\begin{myslide}{Statistics}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 13 official meetings
  \item 4 iterations of the requirement specification
  \item \important{500} emails concerning \Slime\ in my
    mailbox\footnote{including those exchanged directly with the
      participants, but without the approx.\ 700 cvs-log emails.}
  \item approximately
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \important{100} officially reported errors\footnote{none
        confirmed \ldots}
    \item \important{170} Java files
    \item \important{200} class files, i.e. 200 public classes
    \item \important{50} \LaTeX-files (doc, web-pages, requirements)
    \item handfull of other files (Makefiles, Error lists etc.)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{myslide}





\begin{myslide}{Good}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item it's over
  \item we have a running tool ready
  \item nice result for so few people
  \item task distribution
  \item good \important{specification}: \important{formal} semantics
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{myslide}
\begin{myslide}{Neutral/beyond our control}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item not much people, 
  \item lot of (late) drop outs,\footnote{people at the beginning:
      \important{11} (except coaches), at the end: \important{4}} and
    lately announced
  \end{itemize}
\end{myslide}

\begin{myslide}{Less good}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \important{Attracting} students
    \begin{itemize}
    \item another topic?
    \item stressing collaborative  work over programming in \Java?
    \end{itemize}
  \item \important{laaaate} first code delivery (26.\ June) /compilation,
    \important{laaate} integration (with all the consequences)
  \item we always had quite some breaches of \important{interfaces}, but:
    this year was the first time, I had to \important{discuss} why this is
    should be avoided without much discussion
  \item communication
  \item no test group, no Error ever \texttt{confirmed}
  \end{itemize}
\end{myslide}

\begin{myslide}{Next time}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item first \emph{Readme} or first \important{written plan}
    \important{required} to be \important{checked-in} in after 2 weeks
  \item stricter, enforced cvs-strategy?: \important{enforced
    compilability} for checking-in?
\item user \important{logging} (currently, I don't know how, the official
  university's server can do it, but there are other disadvantages of that
  solution)?
  \item stricter surveillance (e.g.\ for absynt), \important{watches}
  \item no \important{separation} between gui and editor? But an explicit
    \important{test} group.
  \item other means of communication? (\emph{news-group?}, cvs-logs?)
  \end{itemize}
\end{myslide}
