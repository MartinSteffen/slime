raw list.
========


+ good spec

+ nice overall result

+ nice division of work.



- this semester: 
  > less coaching supervision because of not so many people
  > more coaching, because of slow start and hectic in the end
     and more programming by us 


- email-responsivity (during semester)


-  

- late!!!! integration, planned was 12, June

- smoothness

- not much people, many drop-outs

- late info' that someone drops out -> late reaction

- late checking in of stuff.

- discipline/professionalism/priorities

- if there is an ``deadly'' simple error, the reaction should be:

     > let's fix it  fast, now and make a good solution later, 
       without further extending the damage or forcing others
       and a local fix is good for some time
   
  and not:

     > let's see who is guilty (it does not matter, everyone makes errors,	
                                it becomes a matter if it's done on purpose)
     > let's discuss it at the time being _what the personally preferred fix is,
       or what the ultimate best fix is, but keep it on the list, and
       fix it together.

     
- communication, no discussions, no feedback, only flame wars

- checking in stuff revant for all without prior communication (and more than once)


- too late communication of errors (for instance 
    change wishes for absynt.)


- nothing checked in till 19 june by most of the groups

- technical problems with using cvs still mid of June (at least)


- unsmart psychological dealing with problems, not even to pretend as if something
  is going on! (i.e. no reactions)


o make a time line, make a statistics
