raw list.


+ good spec




- not much people, many drop-outs

- late info' that someone drops out -> late reaction

- late checking in of stuff.

- discipline

- communication, no discussions, no immediate feedback

- too late communication of errors (for instance 
    change wishes for absynt.)


- nothing checked in till 13 june by most of the groups

- technical problems with using cvs still mid of June (at least)


- unsmart dealing with problems, not even to pretend as if something
  is going on! (i.e. no reactions)
