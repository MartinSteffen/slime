raw list.
========


+ good spec


- email-responsivity

- late integration

- smoothness

- not much people, many drop-outs

- late info' that someone drops out -> late reaction

- late checking in of stuff.

- discipline/professionalism/priorities

- communication, no discussions, no feedback, only flame wars

- checking in stuff revant for all without prior communication (and more than once)


- too late communication of errors (for instance 
    change wishes for absynt.)


- nothing checked in till 19 june by most of the groups

- technical problems with using cvs still mid of June (at least)


- unsmart psychological dealing with problems, not even to pretend as if something
  is going on! (i.e. no reactions)


o make a time line, make a statistics
